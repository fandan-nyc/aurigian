iThe surge of antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and a scarcity of development in new antibiotics necessitates alternative therapeutic approaches. Here we report a nanotherapeutic strategy against S. aureus using a red blood cell membrane (RBCM)-coated stimuli-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) that contain oxygen-bonded hemoglobin (Hb) and naftifine. S. aureus took up the polyunsaturated fatty acids in RBCM, which was subsequently esterified in bacterial cell membrane. Then, under the acidic and hydrogen peroxide-rich infectious microenvironment, Hb initiated lipid peroxidation in S. aureus, thus promoting neutrophil chemotaxis.

Facilitated by the oxygen delivered by Hb in the NP, the recruited neutrophils effectively combated S. aureus via respiratory burst. Additionally, naftifine inhibited staphyloxanthin biosynthesis, while Hb reduced bacterial hydrogen sulfide, thereby sensitizing S. aureus. This dual strategy of promoting neutrophilic response and S. aureus sensitivity enhanced neutrophil-mediated immune clearance. NPs treatment showed excellent therapeutic efficacies in treating persisters, biofilms, and antimicrobial resistant S. aureus-induced pneumonia, peritonitis, and bacteremia. Our findings demonstrated neutrophil-based immunotherapy can be an effective approach for the treatment of infectious diseases.
